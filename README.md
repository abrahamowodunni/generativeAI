# üöÄ My Generative AI Journey

Welcome to my Generative AI repository! This repo serves as a comprehensive documentation of my learning journey, showcasing projects and experiments as I dive deeper into the field of Generative AI, LLMs, and AI development.

## üìö Courses and Learning

Here are some key courses that have contributed to my growth in the field:

1. **Generative AI Fundamentals**: A comprehensive introduction to the principles and development of generative models using frameworks like PyTorch and Hugging Face.
2. **Large Language Models (LLMs) & Text Generation**: Focused on understanding transformer architectures, fine-tuning techniques, and building practical LLM applications.
3. **Building Generative AI Solutions**: Hands-on approach to integrating tools like LangChain, vector databases, and semantic search into generative AI projects.
