    "# LangChain Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chains** in LangChain are sequences of components that process inputs and generate outputs. They allow you to define workflows that combine various elements to accomplish a task. For example, a chain might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt Generation**: Creating a prompt based on input data.\n",
    "- **Model Invocation**: Sending the prompt to an LLM and receiving a response.\n",
    "- **Post-processing**: Modifying or formatting the response before presenting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chains enable complex tasks to be broken down into manageable steps, improving modularity and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents** in LangChain are components that handle decision-making and interaction with external environments. They use LLMs to interpret inputs and decide on actions to take based on predefined rules or dynamic logic. Key aspects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Action Selection**: Deciding which actions to perform based on the model’s output and external conditions.\n",
    "- **Tool Integration**: Interacting with external tools or APIs as part of the decision-making process.\n",
    "- **Contextual Adaptation**: Adapting actions based on context or user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents are useful for building interactive applications where decisions need to be made dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document Loader\n",
    "\n",
    "**Document Loaders** are responsible for ingesting and processing documents into a format suitable for use within LangChain. This often involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extraction**: Pulling text or data from documents (e.g., PDFs, Word files).\n",
    "- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and formatting the data to ensure it’s usable by the system.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: Organizing the data for efficient retrieval and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document loaders are essential for applications that need to work with large amounts of unstructured text or structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memorization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memorization** in LangChain refers to managing conversational context and maintaining state across interactions. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Storage**: Keeping track of previous interactions to maintain continuity in conversations.\n",
    "- **Context Retrieval**: Accessing and utilizing stored context when generating responses or making decisions.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Updates**: Updating context based on new interactions or information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memorization is crucial for applications like chatbots or virtual assistants that need to remember details across multiple user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accessing LLMs** involves interfacing with large language models to generate responses or perform tasks. Key aspects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: Choosing which LLM to use based on the task or requirements (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5).\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting prompts to guide the model’s responses effectively.\n",
    "- **API Integration**: Connecting to the model’s API to send requests and receive responses.\n",
    "- **Output Handling**: Processing and formatting the model’s output for use in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain abstracts many of these details, providing tools and abstractions to simplify the process of working with LLMs, including handling API calls, managing prompts, and processing outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides a comprehensive framework for integrating and managing LLM-based solutions, making it easier to build and maintain sophisticated applications that leverage the power of large language models.\n"

      "Summary: The 2024 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as UEFA Euro 2024 (stylised as UEFA EURO 2024) or simply Euro 2024, was the 17th UEFA European Championship, the quadrennial international football  championship organised by UEFA for the European men's national teams of their member associations. Germany hosted the tournament, which took place from 14 June to 14 July 2024. The tournament involved 24 teams, with Georgia making their European Championship debut. \n",
      "It was the third time that European Championship matches were played on German territory, and the second time in reunified Germany, as West Germany hosted the 1988 tournament, and four matches of the multi-national Euro 2020 were played in Munich. It was the first time the competition was held in what was formerly East Germany, with Leipzig as a host city, as well as the first major tournament since the 2006 FIFA World Cup that Germany served as a solo host nation. The tournament returned to its usual four-year cycle after the 2020 edition was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "Italy were the defending champions, having won the 2020 final against England on penalties, but were eliminated in the round of 16 by Switzerland. Host nation Germany were eliminated by Spain in the quarter-finals; Spain went on to win the tournament for a record fourth time after defeating England 2–1 in the final.\n",

The competition was linked with the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League, which gave countries a secondary route to qualify for the final tournament.\n",
      "A total of 53 UEFA member associations entered the qualifying process. The draw for the qualifying group stage took place at the Festhalle in Frankfurt on 9 October 2022.\n",

The match was the 17th final of the UEFA European Championship, a quadrennial tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of UEFA to decide the champions of Europe. The match was held at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany, on 14 July 2024, and was contested by Spain, in their fifth final, and England, in their second overall and consecutive final. It was England's first appearance in a major men's tournament final held outside their home country.\n",
      "In front of a crowd of 65,600, the final got off to a slow start, with both sides creating few chances as the first half ended goalless. Spain's Rodri was injured before half time, which forced a substitution for Martín Zubimendi at the interval. Spain got off to a strong start in the second half, scoring immediately courtesy of a Nico Williams goal assisted by Lamine Yamal, who became the youngest assister in a European Championship final, a powerful shot from inside the box to make it 1–0. Spain had increasing goalscoring opportunities in the second half before Cole Palmer scored a goal from outside the box for England to make it 1–1, three minutes after being substituted into the match. Spain's renewed efforts paid off when Mikel Oyarzabal scored for Spain four minutes from time to make it 2–1, holding on to a fourth European Championship victory. Nico Williams was named Man of the Match, while Rodri received the Player of the Tournament accolade. Lamine Yamal received the Best Young Player award and became the youngest player to ever win the competition.\n",
      "Spain won the match 2–1 for their record-breaking fourth UEFA European Championship title – after 1964, 2008 and 2012, surpassing Germany as the sole record-winners of the competition, having won for the third time in five European Championship competitions\u001b[0m\n",
